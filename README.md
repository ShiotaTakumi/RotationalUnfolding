## Overview
This program checks whether a given polyhedron, in which all edge lengths are equal, has an overlapping unfolding.

## Algorithm Details
Please refer to the following paper for details:

## Environment Setup
This project uses Python 3.12.0.
If you want to match the environment, please set up the virtual environment using the following steps:
```bash
# Install Python 3.12.0 with pyenv
pyenv install 3.12.0
pyenv local 3.12.0

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
