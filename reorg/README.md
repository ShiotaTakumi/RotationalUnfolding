# Reorganized Layout (Work in Progress)

This directory is a clean redesign of the project layout.

Goals:
- Provide a "normal" entry point for external researchers.
- Remove dependence on the current working directory.
- Separate inputs, generated outputs, and code.
- Prepare for JSON-based I/O in the next step.

Non-goals:
- Do NOT change algorithms.
- Do NOT remove the legacy implementation.
- Do NOT aim for backward compatibility inside this directory.

Status:
- Design-first.
- Code will be imported gradually from the legacy implementation.
